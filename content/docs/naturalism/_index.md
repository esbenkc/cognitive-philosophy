# 🏞 Naturalism

Naturalism is "a theory that relates scientific method to philosophy by affirming that all beings and events in the universe (whatever their inherent character may be) are natural" - Britannica

"Nature" is not ontologically limited, meaning that it is free of **what** exactly Nature is. The main point is that all is derived from it.
